Presentation developped of : SportiPal

  The project consists of a fitness game. The player will need to move his body to
touch the colored circles and gain points. The game works by using a connected
camera to tracks hand and make them collide with the circles. It will show a panel
with your score, the time you elapsed, and a local high score.
  The first idea will be to track hands. We are gonna use cv2, to add the camera,
and then add the other library, mediapipe. This lib has already the ai-like
recognition of hands. With the use of the lib Pygame, it will store both hands in
objects.
